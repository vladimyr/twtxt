The current APIv1 spec for [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) is as follows.

__NOTE:__ This is not a standardized protocol at all. It is however a standard HTTP/JSON API
           with [JWT](https://jwt.io/) for authentication and authorization.

## Transport

The transport is basic HTTP/1.1

You can connect to the API endpoints via any Web Browser client software such
as Chrome, Firefox, cURL or any HTTP web client libraires.

## Serialization

Serialization is JSON. Every request requires a JSON payload even if it is
empty. Most respones will send a JSON payload as their response but not all.
(_some may respond with an empty body and just a HTTP status_).

## Authentiation

Authentication is done by submitting a set of credentials to the `/api/v1/auth`
endpoint and receiving a JWT token. The JWT token is then used in a `Token`
HTTP header in every subsequent request.

## Endpoints

All endpoints have a `/api/v1` URL prefix based on the [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net) pod you are
talking to. For example to hit the `/ping` endpoint of [twtxt.net](https://twtxt.net):

```#!sh
$ curl -q -o - -H 'Accept: application/json' https://twtxt.net/api/v1/ping
{}
```
